# University-Courseworks-MachineLearning-in-Bioinformatics

- Data: 489 neuroblastoma samples
- Features: ~44k

The python file contains code that I developed for my Machine Learning course, to 
- pre-process biological data, 
- undergo feature selection, 
- use the selected features to train multiple models to predict the classes for four target variables.

The pdf file is the printed pdf version of the html file, which is the html version of the python file

My work BEGINS from the part where I find out the ratio of each class of every target variable, 
using a function I created called 'balance'; it stops after that, and then resumes from the "STEPS" part up until the end.
